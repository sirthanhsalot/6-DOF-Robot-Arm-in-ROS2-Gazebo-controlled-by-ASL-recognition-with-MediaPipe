# 6-DOF-Robot-Arm-in-ROS2-Gazebo-controlled-by-ASL-recognition-with-MediaPipe
Inside is a ROS2 workspace for controlling a robot arm with hand gestures. Simulation environment is Gazebo Classics with ros2_control plugins. Gesture recognition is done through Google's MediaPipe HandLandmarker &amp; a custom Keras MLP

You would need to install gazebo_ros2_control instead of the new gz_ros2_control (for Gazebo Sims). This is running on ROS2 Humble and Ubuntu 22.4 LTS.
